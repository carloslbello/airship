# Airship
Airship is a Python-based program to synchronize game saves between clouds, such as iCloud (for iOS) and Steam Cloud (for Steam).

## Downloading and installing

Before installing and running Airship, you must install these dependencies.

- All functionality depends on having Python version 2.7 or above installed and accessible by typing `python` into your terminal or command line. Your operating system may have Python installed already; to check, type `python -V` into your terminal or command line. Otherwise, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads).
- Steam Cloud functionality depends on having Steam installed, logged in, and running while Airship is running. [Download Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/about).
- iCloud functionality depends on running Airship on OS X 10.10 Yosemite or above, being logged into iCloud, and having iCloud Drive synchronization enabled in System Preferences.

Download the latest release by going to 'releases' at the top of the page and going to the most recent release.

## Using
To use, simply run the `airship.py` script. Note that you must be logged in to your iCloud and Steam accounts and that Steam must be running.
